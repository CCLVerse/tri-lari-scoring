For sub-sample A
1) Fit a TRI/LARI measurement model to one competency
2) extract scoring weights from that model,
3) generate multiple LARI/TRI-based scores for participants (one for each Latent variable in the model),
4) correlate each of those LARI/TRI-based scores with outcome variables (e.g., performance first, then derailment later if needed) - round 1

5) generate a set of “typical” scores for each informant, using a more standard scoring procedure
6) correlate each of those typical scores with the same outcome variables, and
7) evaluate whether the two scoring procedures produce differential correlations with the outcomes.
 
For sub-sample B (cross-validation)
8) generate LARI/TRI-based scores for cross-validation participants (using the factor scoring weights derived from sub-sample A),
9) correlate those scores with outcomes,
10) generate “typical” scores for each informant,
11) correlate those typical scores with the same outcomes, and
12) evaluate whether the two scoring procedures produce differential correlations with the outcomes.
